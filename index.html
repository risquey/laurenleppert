    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m Lauren, ex-tech-cubicle escapee turned coaster junkie, part-time bartender, and freelance QA wizard. Iâ€™ve spent years elbow deep in software testing; building, breaking, and fixing automation scripts. Now I split my time between passion projects, contract QA work, and serving up booze and smiles.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I donâ€™t just test thingsâ€”I streamline, debug, and document the hell out of them. I build weird little tools and games for fun (and sometimes usefulness), and Iâ€™m especially good at catching edge cases before they set anything on fire. You want fast feedback and clean documentation? I'm your girl.

  <section id="freelance">
    <h2>Freelance Work</h2>
    <p>
      Currently open to freelance and contract work for QA projectsâ€”manual or automation. Whether you're looking to build your first suite or clean up a flaky one, Iâ€™ve got you covered. I can jump in, get up to speed fast, and actually document with meticulous detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's talk if you need a tester who finds weird bugs, writes clean test cases, and won't ghost you after one sprint.
